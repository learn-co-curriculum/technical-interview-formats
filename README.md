## Technical Interview Formats

Technical interviews are where the magic happens. It’s where you get to meet potential teammates and collaborate with other professionals in your field to solve problems. 

Interviewers may approach the tech portion differently, but the objective is always the same: **assess whether you are the right person to join their team**.

No need to worry though. You’ve been building your technical skill set for months and now it’s time to show off those skills! Let’s go over the different formats and how best to prepare. 

## Formats

Interviews in cybersecurity take many forms. It is important for most hiring teams to assess your culture fit for the workplace as well as your technical readiness. Every company interviews in a different way. Interviews are frequently multiphasic, with anywhere between 2-5 steps before a hiring decision is made. 

Here are the types of interviews you can expect and should be prepared for.

**Pre-screen meeting, phone call or video teleconference**  Generally the recruiter will assess whether you have the skills and interest for the position. They may ask a few trivial technical interview questions related to software, tools, and techniques mentioned in the job description. Questions are more exploratory and informational (Example: Tell me about your experience with LogRhythm.) This type of interview typically lasts 15-30 minutes.

**Take home assessments**   Employers provide candidates with an assessment to determine his or her eligibility for the role. These can take the form of cognitive aptitude assessments (ex: CCAT), technical labs and capture the flags (example: Here's a virtual machine, figure out what's wrong), scenario-based assessments (ex: Write an incident response plan for a fictional company), and code challenges for application security related positions (example: You have a week to write a program using Python that scrapes a website). This type of interview will typically afford you 2-5 business days to complete.

**Traditional technical interview**  Employers will ask a variety of technical questions with relevance to the job description. However, some interviewers will improvise their questions.There is usually only one hiring manager leading the interview. For entry level jobs, computer science, system and network security, and IT security framework questions are common. The cybersecurity curriculum should prepare you well to answer a variety of questions and think on your toes. It's okay to admit you don't know the answer, but you should always give it a try. Verbalize your logic as you think through your answer and ask questions for clarification. If you miss a few answers, it is okay. Immediately following your interview research the answers and send an email to your interviewer with your corrections. This will demonstrate a strong enthusiasm for continuous learning as well as some humility. Like panel interviews, this type of interview will typically last between 30-60 minutes.
 
## Aptitude Assessments 
Pre-employment aptitude assessment and assignments are becoming more common in the interview process, and you may be asked to complete these by potential employers.  Research shows that cognitive aptitude is one of the most accurate predictors of job success: twice as predictive as job interviews, three times as predictive as experience, and four times as predictive as education level.  

An example of an aptitude assessment is the CCAT -  [Criteria Cognitive Aptitude Test](https://www.criteriacorp.com/solution/ccat.php) The CCAT is a pre-employment aptitude test that measures an individual's aptitude, or ability to solve problems, digest and apply information, learn new skills, and think critically. Individuals with high aptitude are more likely to be quick learners and high performers than are individuals with low aptitude. The CCAT consists of 50 items; very few people finish all 50 items in the 15 minute time limit.  Each individual is given a score report - a raw score and a percentile ranking. The raw score indicates how many questions (out of 50) the individual answered correctly, while the percentile ranking is a relative performance metric that indicates how the individual scored relative to others who have taken the test. For example, a percentile ranking of 45 means that an individual scored better than 45% of the group on which the test was normed.
